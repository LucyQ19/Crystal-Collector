# Crystal-Collector!!
##How My Game Works:

* It is a guessing game where the player uses hidden numbers to match a random-generated number.
* There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player is shown a random number between 19 and 120 at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystals it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.  The amount of each crystal will be between 1 and 12 points.
* The player wins the game if his/her total score matches the random number; and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
* The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.
* The number of games won and/or lost are also displayed.
* If the player successfully matches his/her total score to the random number, they get 1 win. If the player's total score is greater than the random number, the player get 1 loss.  Afterwards the game restarts.
* When the game is restarted, the playter is shown a new random number, each of the crystals have different values, and the player's total score is reseted back to zero.
